##Security risk Estimation Tool##

**Purpose:**

This project outlines the design and development of an Security risk Estimation Tool, a software application designed to assist organizations in evaluating risks associated with their software and web applications. The tool leverages the OWASP Risk Rating Methodology to provide a structured approach for assessing potential threats and their potential impact.

**Key Features:**

* **OWASP Risk Rating Methodology Adherence:** The tool strictly follows the OWASP Risk Rating Methodology, ensuring a consistent and reliable risk assessment process.
* **Likelihood and Impact Estimation:** Users can assess risks by estimating the likelihood of exploitation and the potential impact on both business and technical factors.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** The tool is designed to be intuitive and easy to use, making it accessible to a wide range of users, including security professionals and developers.
* **Prioritization of Security Measures:** The tool helps organizations identify vulnerabilities and prioritize security measures based on their associated risks.

**Benefits:**

* **Improved Risk Management:** By providing a structured approach to risk assessment, the tool helps organizations better understand and manage potential threats.
* **Enhanced Security Posture:** By identifying and prioritizing vulnerabilities, organizations can take proactive steps to strengthen their security posture.
* **Informed Decision Making:** The tool empowers organizations to make informed decisions about risk mitigation strategies.

**Project Goals:**

* Develop a robust and user-friendly risk estimation tool that aligns with the OWASP Risk Rating Methodology.
* Provide organizations with a reliable and effective means of assessing and managing risks in their software and web applications.
* Contribute to the overall security and resilience of software systems.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Installation:** Follow the installation instructions provided in the project documentation.
